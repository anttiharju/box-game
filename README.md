# Box Collector
**The first game I ever made.** Programmed by the 12-year-old me all the way back in 2011 with help from my sister's boyfriend. By accident the original source managed to survive on [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/47537) even though it is no longer playable there. The purpose of this repo is to preserve the game and satisfy my personal nostalgia. I also really want to mention that the game's name in Finnish is Laatikkomörkö (Box Bogeyman). This repo includes:
- [Original](/original/original.pde) uncensored source code written by the 12-year-old me.
- [Improved version](/docs/docs.js) based on the original to have easy access to a [playable version](https://harju.io/box-game/).
