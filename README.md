# Box Collector
**The first game I ever made.** Programmed by the 12-year-old me all the way back in 2011 with help from my sister's then-boyfriend-now-husband. By accident the original source managed to survive on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/15161/) even though it is no longer playable there. The purpose of this repo is to preserve the game and satisfy my personal nostalgia. I also really want to mention that the game's name in Finnish is Laatikkomörkö (Box Bogeyman). This repo includes:
- *Original* uncensored source code written by the 12-year-old me.
- *Web* version to have easy access to a [playable version](http://users.jyu.fi/~anvemaha/box-game/).
